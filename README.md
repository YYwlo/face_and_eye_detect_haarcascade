# face_and_eye_detect_haarcascade
Use haarcascade file and Opencv to detect face and eye from image file, video and realtime webcam.

# 3 versions of program
- real time webcam version
- video file version
- image file version

In these files have video and image example to test program.

# But This method (haarcascade or HOG) has low accuracy , if you want to use for more accuracy, I recommend CNN or DNN algorithm (But maybe slow)
